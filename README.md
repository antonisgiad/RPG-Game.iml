Java RPG Game Simulation

Overview
This is a Java-based Role-Playing Game (RPG) simulation project featuring heroes, monsters, items, spells, turn-based combat, and a grid-based world with markets and interactive elements.

Features
Heroes: Team of 1â€“3, each as Warrior, Sorcerer, or Paladin (each with unique strengths).

Monsters: Dragons (high damage), Exoskeletons (strong defense), Spirits (high evasion).

Items:

Weapons: For damage (one or two hands required).

Armors: Reduce incoming damage.

Potions: Temporary stat boosts (single use).

Spells:

Ice Spell: Reduces enemy damage for a few rounds.

Fire Spell: Reduces enemy defense for a few rounds.

Lighting Spell: Reduces enemy's dodge chance for a few rounds.

Grid World:

Accessible and non-accessible tiles, markets, common tiles for random battles.

Optional: Rivers (require fatigue to cross) and caves (require a shovel from the market).

Gameplay
Turn-based combat: Heroes vs. Monsters, fighting continues until one side is defeated.

Hero actions: Attack, cast spell, use potion, or equip gear on each turn.

Earn gold and experience by defeating monsters; level up to improve stats.

Heroes level up to gain stat increases based on class.

Each hero manages their own inventory and uses a market to buy/sell at half price.

Explore the map: move up, down, left, right, display hero locations.

View stats or inventory at any time, or quit the game any time.

Optional Enhancements
Fatigue system: Heroes lose fatigue when performing certain actions or crossing terrain; can rest outside combat.

Additional map features: Rivers and caves for more variety and strategy.
